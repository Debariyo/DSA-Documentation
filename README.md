## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis 

### Project Overview: Analysis of Product and Customer Review Data for Strategic Insights

This project focuses on analyzing product and customer review data sourced from Amazon. The objective is to generate actionable insights that support product development, refine marketing strategies, and improve customer engagement for our clients.

This involves the collection, cleaning, and exploratory analysis of product performance metrics and textual customer reviews. Using tools like Excel, and visualization platforms such as PivotTable, I identify trends, pain points, and opportunities within customer feedback.

Key areas of analysis include:

* **Product Rating Trends:** Understanding average ratings across categories and time to assess product satisfaction.
* **Sentiment Analysis of Reviews:** Categorizing reviews as positive, negative, or neutral to determine customer perception.
* **Keyword Extraction & Topic Modeling:** Identifying frequently mentioned features, issues, or benefits in customer reviews.
* **Top/Low Performing Products:** Comparing products by combining rating and review volume to identify high-impact performers or underperformers.
* **Customer Segmentation :** Grouping customers based on their review behavior or product preferences.
