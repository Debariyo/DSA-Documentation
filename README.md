The journey of becoming a professional data analyst...

## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis 

### Project Overview: Analysis of Product and Customer Review Data for Strategic Insights

As a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, my project focuses on analyzing product and customer review data sourced from Amazon. The objective is to generate actionable insights that support product development, refine marketing strategies, and improve customer engagement for our clients.

This involves the collection, cleaning, and exploratory analysis of product performance metrics and textual customer reviews. Using tools like Excel, and visualization platforms such as PivotTable, I identify trends, pain points, and opportunities within customer feedback.

Key areas of analysis include:

* **Product Rating Trends:** Understanding average ratings across categories and time to assess product satisfaction.
* **Sentiment Analysis of Reviews:** Categorizing reviews as positive, negative, or neutral to determine customer perception.
* **Keyword Extraction & Topic Modeling:** Identifying frequently mentioned features, issues, or benefits in customer reviews.
* **Top/Low Performing Products:** Comparing products by combining rating and review volume to identify high-impact performers or underperformers.
* **Customer Segmentation :** Grouping customers based on their review behavior or product preferences.

The final deliverables include:

* A dashboard summarizing key findings.
* A report highlighting recommendations for product improvement and marketing messaging.
* A presentation for internal stakeholders and select client teams.

Through this project, I aim to contribute to data-driven decision-making that enhances product quality, aligns marketing with customer expectations, and increases customer satisfaction and loyalty.
