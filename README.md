## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis 

### Project Overview: Analysis of Product and Customer Review Data for Strategic Insights

This project focuses on analyzing product and customer review data sourced from Amazon. The objective is to generate actionable insights that support product development, refine marketing strategies, and improve customer engagement for our clients.

This involves the collection, cleaning, and exploratory analysis of product performance metrics and textual customer reviews. Using tools like Excel, and visualization platforms such as PivotTable, I identify trends, pain points, and opportunities within customer feedback.

Key areas of analysis include:

* **Product Rating Trends:** Understanding average ratings across categories and time to assess product satisfaction.
* **Sentiment Analysis of Reviews:** Categorizing reviews as positive, negative, or neutral to determine customer perception.
* **Keyword Extraction & Topic Modeling:** Identifying frequently mentioned features, issues, or benefits in customer reviews.
* **Top/Low Performing Products:** Comparing products by combining rating and review volume to identify high-impact performers or underperformers.
* **Customer Segmentation :** Grouping customers based on their review behavior or product preferences.

#### Data Source
The primary source of data used here is Amazon case study.xlsx. It was provided by the company. 

#### ðŸ”§ Tools Used
* **Microsoft Excel:** For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
* **PivotTables & PivotCharts:** To summarize and explore product ratings, review counts, and customer sentiment trends
* **Excel Dashboard:** For visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) like top-rated products, review volume, and product performance metrics
* **Conditional Formatting & Data Validation:** To enhance data readability and accuracy

#### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of the Data Cleaning and preparation, we pwerform the following actions:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data Cleaning and formatting

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploration of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as:
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category? 
2. How many products are listed under each category? 
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?  
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?

#### ðŸ“Š Data Analysis

The analysis was performed entirely in Microsoft Excel using built-in functions, PivotTables, and dashboard components. Below are examples of techniques and formulas used:
**ðŸ“Œ Sample Excel Functions Used:**

* `=AVERAGEIF(range, criteria, average_range)` â€“ to calculate average rating per product category
* `=COUNTIF(range, criteria)` â€“ to count specific review types (e.g., 1-star, 5-star)
* `=IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)` â€“ for conditional flagging (e.g., low-rated products)

**ðŸ“Œ PivotTable & PivotChart Usage:**

* Created PivotTables to summarize:

  * Total number of reviews by product
  * Average rating by category
  * Monthly review trends
* Used PivotCharts to visualize:

  * Rating distribution
  * Top 5 and bottom 5 products
  * Review volume over time

**ðŸ“Œ Dashboard Components:**

* Slicers added for filtering by:

  * Product category
  * Rating level
  * Time period
* Conditional formatting to highlight:

  * Products with average rating < 3
  * Products with highest review volume
